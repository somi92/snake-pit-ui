# snake-pit-ui

snake-pit-ui is a project written in Java and Swing that serves as a GUI for both [snake-pit](https://github.com/somi92/snake-pit) and [clojure-snake](https://github.com/somi92/clojure-snake) projects. 

[snake-pit](https://github.com/somi92/snake-pit) is a student project written in Clojure to demonstrate application of genetic programming to the snake game. The goal of the project is to evolve the snake game AI.

[clojure-snake](https://github.com/somi92/clojure-snake) is a simple implementation of the snake game written in Clojure and Swing. It also has the ability to use the AI output of the snake-pit project.

It presents a convenient interface that enables the user to experiment with GP parameters and evolve the AI, run and display the AI in action, as well as starting manual play of the game.

## Installation and usage

## Options

* Manual play
  - Starts the clojure-snake in manual mode with the ability to set the speed of the game.
* Load and run snake AI
  - Presents an interface for loading the AI (control routine) produced by snake-pit and calls the clojure-snake to display the AI in action. Use ctrl-V to paste the control routine or enter it manually. The user can also load a hardcoded demo AI with a click of a button. To see how a valid control routine looks like please refer to documentation of the [snake-pit](https://github.com/somi92/snake-pit) project.
* Breed snakes
  - Presents an interface for working with snake-pit library. The user can set GP parameters and run the GP engine. The GP reports back the result and the status of the run. Results can be saved to a text file along with the parameters of the associated run. For description of the available GP parameters please refer to documentation of the [snake-pit](https://github.com/somi92/snake-pit) project.
* About
  - Presents information about the project.
